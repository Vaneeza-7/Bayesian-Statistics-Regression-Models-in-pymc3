# Bayesian Statistics: Regression Models and Related Concepts on Iris dataset in pymc3

This repository contains the assignments for the course *Statistical Modelling: Bayesian Analysis with Python.*
- [Bayesian Model estimate for dice](https://github.com/Vaneeza-7/Bayesian-Model-estimate-for-dice/blob/main/bayesian_model_diceRoll.ipynb) is a simple linear model and explores the effect of beta values on likelihood.
- [Correlation and Linear Regression](https://github.com/Vaneeza-7/Bayesian-Model-estimate-for-dice/blob/main/Correlation%20%26%20Linear%20Regression.ipynb) includes Linear regression models for iris dataset with calculations for pearson correlation coefficient and r-squared values.
- [Multi-linear regression models](https://github.com/Vaneeza-7/Bayesian-Model-estimate-for-dice/blob/main/Multiple%20Linear%20Model.ipynb) includes multi-linear regression models and relatd concepts of multicollinearit, confounding variables etc.
